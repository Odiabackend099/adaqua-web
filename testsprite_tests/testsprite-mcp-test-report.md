## 6ï¸âƒ£ Test Report Summary

**Overall Status:** âŒ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

The voice assistant has **fundamental rendering and service availability issues** that prevent core functionality testing. While some features like barge-in support and accessibility work correctly, the main voice conversation experience cannot be verified due to:

1. **Empty voice page rendering** (blocks UI testing)
2. **TTS service unavailability** (blocks audio conversation)
3. **Development environment setup gaps** (blocks automated testing)

**Recommendation:** Address critical issues before proceeding with user testing. The application needs frontend rendering fixes and TTS service resolution to provide the conversational AI experience you're looking for.
